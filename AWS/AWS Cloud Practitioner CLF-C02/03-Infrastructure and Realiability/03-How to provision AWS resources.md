# Ways to interact with AWS services

## AWS Management Console
- **Web-based interface for accessing and managing AWS services**. You can quickly access recently used services and search for other services by name, keyword, or acronym. 
- The console includes wizards and automated workflows that can simplify the process of completing tasks.
- You can also use the AWS Console mobile application to perform tasks such as monitoring resources, viewing alarms, and accessing billing information. 
- Multiple identities can stay logged into the AWS Console mobile app at the same time.

## AWS Command Line Interface
- **Control multiple AWS services directly from the command line within one tool**. 
- Available for users on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- By using AWS CLI, **you can automate the actions that your services and applications perform through scripts**.

## Software Development Kits(SDKs)
- **Use AWS services through an API designed for your programming language or platform**. 
- **SDKs enable you to use AWS services with your existing applications or create entirely new applications that will run on AWS**.
- AWS provides documentation and sample code for each supported programming language. Supported programming languages include C++, Java, .NET, and more.

## AWS CloudFormation
- **Treat your infrastructure as code**. This means that **you can build an environment by writing lines of code instead of using the AWS Management Console** to individually provision resources.
- Provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner, enabling you to frequently build your infrastructure and applications without having to perform manual actions.
- It determines the right operations to perform when managing your stack and rolls back changes automatically if it detects errors.
